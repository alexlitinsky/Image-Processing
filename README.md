# Image-Processing
- An application where you can load images and apply transformations to those images
- Used MVC Paradigm
- Implemented using Command Design Pattern
- Tested using Mocks
- Made using Java & JFrame

# Features
- Brighten: brightens the image
- Darken: darkens the image
- Greyscale: applies a greyscale
- verticalflip: flips an image vertically
- horizontalflip: flips an image horizontally
- sharpen: sharpens an image
- sepia: applies a sepia filter to an image
- blur: blurs an image
- lumacomp: applies a luma filter
- redcomp: applies the red value to every part of the pixel in the image
- greencomp:applies the green value to every part of the pixel in the image
- bluecomp: applies the blue value to every part of the pixel in the image
- valuecomp: computes the average of each pixel in the image

# How to run
- Open the file with your favorite java IDE
- Make a run configuration using the GraphicalImageProcessing class
- Under program arguments, type in either "interactive" or "script"
- *Note* to run under script, you have to have your images in the main file folder
- Under interactive argument, a GUI will be projected, where you can upload an image, and manipulate it with any transformation!
- To the right side of the GUI, a histogram will be projected, where you can see the overall pixel densities of that image
- With your accompanied transformation, you can save the new image you created!
